## Improvements

The following improvements could be made in the project, if there was a longer time to implement it: 

 - Add a pagination feature(the data is static data right now, so the pagination is not required)
 - Add a search feature(implement a search feature so that its easy for the user to navigate around and find the appropriate room for themselves)
 - Performance optimization(we can load the images in the site according to the bandwidth of the user so that there is a better performance)\
